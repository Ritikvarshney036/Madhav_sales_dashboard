# Madhav Ecommerce Sales Dashboard

➡ I created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data.

➡ Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers.

➡ Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations.

➡ Used different types of customized visualization(bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, slicers, etc ).
